# TheSoulbiz

TheSoulbiz is a simple blog to share and explore some new & old technologies and (hopefully) some helpful tricks!

It is based on the [Lagrange](https://github.com/LeNPaul/Lagrange) layout.

### Added

* A tag system to sort the posts by keywords.
You can navigate a normal tag list or tag cloud for that purpose.
You can also check a post's tags at the end of it!
That way you can directly access the index listing the other posts that share the same tag.

* Stylish card-like entries in the "About" section (taken from _includes).

* "Friends" menu tab with other people's sites. Could be used as a "Related sites".

* Own Disqus comment section per post.

* Own Docker social-icon w/ link to my profile and dockers.

* Many CSS visual changes while keeping it minimalist!

### Posts

Right now, it keeps the original sample posts.

I added a How-To with the steps required to add the Tag-Cloud tab.

The post list keeps a "paginator" that can be modified from the _config.yml file.
